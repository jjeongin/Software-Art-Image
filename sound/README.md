## Audio Reactive Animation for 250's Bang Bus
This program is an audio reactive animation for *Bang Bus* from the album, PPONG, by a South Korea-based DJ named 250. The album, PPONG is a reinterpretation of Korean Trot music. According to wikipedia, trot music is a genre of Korean pop music known for its use of repetitive rhythm and vocal inflections. It is usually popular among older generation of Korean people such as my grandparents' generation. However, this album remixed the trot music into modern electronic dance music. Inspired by that, I tried to recreate the visual components from Korean traditional art into a rhythmical animation that reminds viewers of modern club scenes. The animation reactively responds to the beat of the music and the user can tune the volume and speed of animation with GUI when they click the 'g' key.
