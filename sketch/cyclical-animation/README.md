## Description
Cyclical animation of a flower blooming repititively. To make the overall visual more interesting and dynamic, I added overlapping layers of the same video looping over and over with the variation of color and transparency as the time passes. The endlessly continued looping and the slightly missed timing between the fading and looping of the videos add unique a rhythm to the visual and provoke tension. Each differently tinted grid is composed together to create one whole image.
