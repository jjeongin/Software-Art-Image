# Final Project
## Meta-clothes Design Tool â›“
This program is an inter-boundary fashion design tool for us living in the metaverse era. The user can generate a custom 3d graphic on the avatar by interacting with the screen with 10 mouse clicks. The final user-generated graphic is diaplayed on the webcam image so that users can "try it on" in the real world. This work is inspired by the rising trend of NFT fashion brands and their digital garments; how it blurs the boundary between two different spces and applies a new layer on the physical materials. - Can these "digital filters" considered as real garments? Exploring this idea, I aimed to encourage viewers to question their perception of the self persona and the boundary between the physical and digital materials.
